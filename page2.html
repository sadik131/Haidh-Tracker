                Imaam Birgivi refers to his book, the knowledge contained therein, as “ذخر” e.g. “Treasure trove” to
                highlight the valuable nature of the subject matter for those who are accordingly Mukallaf(answerable)
                to Allah Ta'ala:

                <p class="font-nunito text-sm lg:text-xl text-text">“المتأهلين” literally means “those who are married”,
                    e.g.
                    husbands
                    specifically (as this word would not be used to refer to “wives” in the Arabic language.). Below
                    follow a few points to highlight the beauty of the Arabic language:</p>
            </div>
            <div class="pl-10">
                <div class="flex lg:pl-10">
                    <span class="list-item text-text"></span>
                    <p class="font-nunito text-sm lg:text-xl z-20 text-text">The word “تأهّل”, in terms of its root
                        words, “ا-ه-ل” means
                        family and
                        “تأهّل” means “to get married”. It is interesting to take note here that in Arabic
                        Morphology,
                        this
                        specific form of the verb can communicate special attributes. From the many possibilities,
                        we
                        can
                        find that the meaning of “صيرورة” is manifested here. In its essence, this meaning indicates
                        that a
                        new transition and a change in one's situation has taken place. The literal translation
                        therefore
                        would be: “صار الرجل ذا أهل”, meaning: “The person became a family man”. Part and parcel of
                        such
                        a
                        profound transition in this context is the requirement for one to become aware of the
                        various
                        rulings/responsibilities that apply to family life, including those specifically pertaining
                        to
                        his
                        wife and other womenfolk. From a Shari' perspective, the husband is accountable that each
                        member
                        of
                        his family has the opportunity to acquire the requisite knowledge to please Allah Ta'ala.
                        Imaam
                        Birgivi emphasized this point in the title of his work and has further clarrified this in
                        his
                        Muqaddimah (Introduction) under:

                    “to be fit”; which again marries nicely with the social contract that started between Adam and Hawa
                    'Alayhimus Salaam where Allah Ta'ala made them for each other. Islam emphasizes the suitability of
                    both partners to one and another to encourage a long and prosperous marriage.</p>

                        that same meaning a small step further brings us to the word: “اهليّة”, which means
                        “competence”,
                        “aptitude”. In this perspective, one could argue that the Arabic language is hinting that
                        despite
                        the difficulties inherent with the transition into marriage, in order for a man to become

                <p class="font-nunito text-sm lg:text-xl text-text">“النساء” which unsurprisingly means “women”. As these special days in question are specific to women, it follows by necessity that they cary the primary responsibility to obtain the required knowledge to adequately discharge their day-to-day affairs. However, as the title of Imaam Birgivi's work makes clear, menfolk (e.g. husbands and fathers) also share in this responsibility. Imaam Birgivi further clarrified this point in his Muqaddimah (Introduction), stating: “As such, knowledge of bleedings specific to women is Waajib(obligatory) on them, as well as upon their husbands and their guardians”. This responsibility has been explained by Imaam Birgivi as stating: “and (Allah Ta'ala) commanded them to advice their womenfolk, to discipline and to teach religion”, in the sense that Allah Ta'ala has appointed men as the head of the household. Just as it is their responsibility to provide for their womenfolk in terms of food, clothing and shelter; likewise they are also responsible to teach religion and be involved in their children's lives in terms of educating them with good character. Teaching religion can vary from obtaining expertise in the underlying jurisprudence of menstruation and postpartum bleeding, to asking scholars for clarifications, to providing for the means of education on these matters. But the crux of the matter is, just like in the case of a Fard al-Kifaayah where everyone is absolved if a group within the community has discharged the responsibility; but everyone is implicated if nobody has discharged the responsibility; likewise the menfolk too will be implicated in the sin of negligence when there was a failure in his household to practice on the correct knowledge pertaining to the jurisprudence of menstruation.</p>

                <p class="font-nunito lg:text-2xl text-sm text-text mb-3">The last part of: “الأطهار و الدماء” is easily translated as: “ritual purity and bleedings”, which encompasses Hayd(menstruation), Nifaas(postpartum bleeding), Istihadah(dysfunctional bleeding) and any ritual purity one may attain through Ghusl(major ablution), Wudu(minor ablution), Tayammum(substituted ablution) as well the ritual purity between two Hayd or between Nifaas and Hayd of minimum 15 days.</p>
                <p class="font-nunito lg:text-2xl text-sm text-text mb-3">The word that we skipped inbetween: “في تعريف”
                    is
                    translated as “the
                    specification of ...”, which is a meaning that can be appreciated by exemplifying this from the
                    perspective of Nahwa(Arabic Grammar). A noun can be Nakirah(unspecified) or Ma'rifah(specified). For
                    instance, take the noun “Zaid”. It is a name that refers to a specific person. On the other hand,
                    one could talk instead about “a man” in the generic sense of the word, which in Arabic would be:
                    “رَجُلٌ” “rajulun”. Such a word is Nakirah, unspecified. We can make the unspecified specific by
                    virtue of applying what is called “اداة التعريف”, namely by putting the definite article “ال” in
                    front of it, so it becomes: “الرَجُل” “al-rajulu”; e.g. the man. Not just any man, but a specific
                    man whose name we may or may not know. So similarly, what Imaam Birgivi is conveying in this title
                    is that the book in question is a treasure trove for both men and women alike when it comes to
                    dealing with the various type of bleedings and ritual purity that may occur in those special,
                    feminine days. To the untrained eye, those different bleedings may all seem the same; unspecified.
                    But thanks to this treasure trove, both men and women alike have access to the correct tools to
                    specify the unspecified; so that the heap of 15 days of bleeding can become adequately distinguished
                    as this specific, consecutive set of bleedings will be Hayd(menstruation)/Nifaas(postpartum
                    bleeding) whereas the rest is to be discounted as Istihadah(dysfunctional bleeding).</p>
